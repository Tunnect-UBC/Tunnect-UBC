We believe that music is a fantastic way to connect with other people and we also believe that sharing music with others can deepen your appreciation of music.
Based on this belief our app will attempt to connect people through their music interests. The app will match users using a tinder style interface wherein 
users will see samples of other users music interests that will be provided using the Spotify API. If both users like the other user's music then they will 
be matched and given the opportunity to message each other and share tracks, albums, and artists with each other. The target demographic will primarily be 
young adults who are looking to make friends through music or are simply trying to expand their musical horizons. However, the app has the potential to be 
used by individuals of all ages seeing as interest in music is not defined by age.
